## Background
In this project, I visualized the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, I've identified the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

### Deliverable 1 
I created a Horizontal Bar Chart to display the top 10 bacteria cultures found.

## Deliverable 2 
Created a Bubble Chart to visualize the number of cultures found per sample.

## Deliverable 3
Created a Gauge Chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and displays the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

## Deliverable 4 
Customize the Dashboard using my knowledge of HTML and Bootstrap.
